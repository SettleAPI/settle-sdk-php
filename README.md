# PHP SDK for connecting to the Settle Payment Platform

**Start accepting payments via Settle in seconds** âœ¨

An easy to use **SDK** for **PHP** with all the best practices to kickstart your integration with the **Settle Payment Platform**.

## Installation

`composer require settle/settle-sdk-php`

## Usage

The library provides a basic Client class that handles the communication with the Settel REST API:  

```php
$settle_client = new SettleApiClient(
    SETTLE_MERCHANT_ID,
    SETTLE_USER_ID,
    SETTLE_PUBLIC_KEY,
    SETTLE_PRIVATE_KEY,
    SETTLE_IN_SANDBOX
);
```

The library then provides an entry point class for each section in the [REST API](https://api.support.settle.eu/api/reference/rest/v1/).
Currently, only MerchantsApi is available as Permissions and OAuth2 are pending breaking changes and will be added soon.


### Merchants API
The following class serves as an entry point for all the resources in the section:  
```php
$merchant_api = new MerchantApi($settle_client);
```
Each resource (class) can be accessed via magic property on the Merchants API object:

```php
$merchant_api->api_keys->...;
$merchant_api->balance->...;
$merchant_api->payment_requests->...;
$merchant_api->payment_sends->...;
$merchant_api->pos->...;
$merchant_api->profile->...;
$merchant_api->settlements->...;
$merchant_api->short_links->...;
$merchant_api->status_codes->...;
```

The methods that each class implements very closely matches the REST API specification:

```php
$merchant_api->api_keys->list();
$merchant_api->api_keys->get($api_key_id);
$merchant_api->api_keys->create($api_key_data);
$merchant_api->api_keys->update($api_key_id, $api_key_data);
$merchant_api->api_keys->delete($api_key_id);
```

Only `PaymentRequests` class has a few extra helper methods:

```php
$merchant_api->payment_requests->capture($payment_request_id,$currency,$amount)
$merchant_api->payment_requests->refund($payment_request_id, $currency, $amount);
$merchant_api->payment_requests->getPaymentLink($payment_request_id);
$merchant_api->payment_requests->getDynamicLink($payment_request_id);
```

### Webhooks / Callbacks
In order to validate callback requests from Settle, both Apache and nginx servers require manual setup to pass the `Authorization` header to PHP. 

Here's an example for Apache:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [e=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```

Here's an example for nginx:
```
proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
proxy_pass_header  Authorization;
```

Two methods on the `SettleApiClient` class can be used in relation to the callbacks:

```php
// the following will return 
$is_valid = $settle_client->isValidCallback($callbackUrl, $body, $headers, $method);

// the following method will grab the data Settle sent in the current request
$settle_data = $settle_client->getCallbackData();  
```

### Dynamic links
Payment requests have a helper method for creating dynamic links but this is only a subset of all the cases when one might need a dynamic link.
The main method for creating dynamic links can be found in the `SettleApiClient` class:

```php
$dynamic_link = $settle_client->createDynamicLink([
    'shortLink' => 'https://settle.eu/s/gSpEb/pos123/'
]);
```
